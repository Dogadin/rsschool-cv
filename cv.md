### About Me

I started my career as a radio engineer.
But quickly became involved in programming. Since 2003 I have been a Lotus Domino developer.\
Now there is a desire to learn new technologies. So I decided to learn Java and JavaScript.\
It will be great if I can put my new knowledge into practice.
